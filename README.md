# GettingStartedWithThreeJS
A simple html + css + vanilla JS project to grasp all the possible features of Three.js library.

# What was created?
<p>Three cubes with different colors and three icosahedrons ( It is a polyhedron with 20 faces ), which positions are connected. The cubes with connected icosahedrons move tangentially (like in a Math.tan() function) in the down direction. Each cube rotates differently, as well as each icosahedron except the central pair.</p>
<p>They move into a square, which was created from vectors, and which is rotated around z-axis.</p>
